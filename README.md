## Project: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
> In this project,  build and train your mlp Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

## Project: Dog-Breed Classifier
> In this project, build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  
> Developed one model from scratch and another using transfer learning.

## Project: Generate TV Scripts
> Generate a TV script by defining and training a recurrent neural network. Generate the text and having prime word to one of the following to start the prediction:
> 1. "jerry"
> 2. "elaine"
> 3. "george"
> 4. "kramer"
>

## Project: Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
> In this project, build and deploy a neural network which predicts the sentiment of a user-provided movie review. In addition, you will create a simple web app that uses your deployed model.
